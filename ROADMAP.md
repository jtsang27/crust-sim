# Clash Royale Engine Modernization Roadmap (Rust)

## Overview
This document defines the full roadmap to rebuild the legacy JavaScript Clash Royale engine into a modular, deterministic, and high-performance Rust simulation engine.

The final product should support:
- AI-ready tick-based logic
- Human-playable browser UI (WASM)
- Replay serialization and playback
- External WebSocket API for AI training or bots
- Deterministic simulation with reproducible seeds

## Phase 1: Legacy Analysis & Data Extraction
**Goal:** Extract game logic and card data from the old JS engine.

**Tasks**
1. Parse the old `index.js` and extract:
   - Card types, stats, and behaviors
   - Arena geometry
   - Tick/update rules and time delta
2. Export data as JSON (`scripts/cards.json`)
3. Define a schema for card definitions.

**Deliverables**
- `scripts/extract_cards.js` generates `cards.json`
- Markdown summary of extracted rules

**Success Criteria**
- `cards.json` accurately reflects legacy card stats

---

## Phase 2: Core Engine Skeleton
**Goal:** Build the Rust foundation for the simulation.

**Tasks**
1. Create the `engine` crate with:
   ```rust
   pub struct GameState;
   pub struct Entity;
   pub fn step(&mut self, dt: f32);

Add deterministic RNG (e.g., oorandom)

Implement tick loop that updates entities

Deliverables

CLI simulation printing entity states

Deterministic output using fixed seed

Success Criteria

Same seed produces identical tick logs

Phase 3: Cards and Elixir System

Goal: Implement basic player loop, deck, and elixir regeneration.

Tasks

Add PlayerState with hand, deck, elixir

Define Card struct with metadata and costs

Implement card deployment and elixir usage

Add 5+ test cards (Knight, Archers, Giant, Fireball, Arrows)

Deliverables

CLI sim with two scripted players

JSON output showing card plays and elixir consumption

Success Criteria

Deterministic duel output consistent across runs

Phase 4: Collision & Targeting

Goal: Enable combat and targeting systems.

Tasks

Add collision, attack, and death systems

Use circular or grid-based collision detection

Implement targeting logic (nearest, tower priority)

Add HP, damage, and projectile systems

Deliverables

CLI output includes attacks and HP updates

Unit test verifying tower kill within expected ticks

Success Criteria

Unit deaths and tower destruction behave as expected

Phase 5: Replay & Serialization

Goal: Make every match fully replayable.

Tasks

Add serde serialization to GameState and Action

Record all actions + states per tick

Implement deterministic replay loading from JSON

Deliverables

cargo run -- replay replays/match1.json reproduces match

Recorded JSON logs match deterministic checksum

Success Criteria

Replayed matches produce identical outputs

Phase 6: Browser/WASM Viewer

Goal: Add an interactive or visual UI similar to the old JS version.

Tasks

Add viewer crate using wasm-bindgen + Trunk

Render arena + entities on an HTML5 canvas

Add mouse/tap input for manual play

Support replay visualization

Deliverables

trunk serve runs playable browser demo

Visual playback for saved replays

Success Criteria

Browser viewer renders and updates at 60 FPS

Phase 7: AI & WebSocket Bridge

Goal: Expose engine to external programs for automation or RL training.

Tasks

Create bridge crate using tokio-tungstenite

Implement commands:

get_state → returns serialized JSON

step → advance simulation

action → play card

Build minimal Python SDK client for testing

Deliverables

WebSocket bridge running on localhost

Python test script connects and plays a match

Success Criteria

External agent can control simulation and receive state

Phase 8: Optimization & Extensibility

Goal: Improve performance and modularity.

Tasks

Add ECS or parallel update (e.g., hecs or rayon)

Configurable JSON card/arena definitions

Abstract systems into traits (UpdateSystem, RenderSystem)

Document architecture

Deliverables

Benchmarks showing 1000+ matches/sec

ENGINE_ARCHITECTURE.md describing modules

Success Criteria

Engine modular, deterministic, and performant

Best Practices

Always use seeded RNG for determinism

Fixed timestep simulation (e.g., 0.016s)

Validate correctness via deterministic replays

Keep JS engine as behavioral oracle

Incrementally migrate systems, test at each phase

Log state transitions for debugging

End State

When complete, this Rust project should provide:

A deterministic, reproducible Clash Royale-style simulator

Modular systems for expansion

Browser-based UI for visualization

External control via WebSocket API

Replay serialization for training and analysis

Clear architecture documentation for future contributors
